# Natural Language Processing Projects 
 
This is my portfolio of Natural Language Processing projects. Each project includes a brief overview, the tools and technologies used, and the outcomes achieved. All of the code and relevant datasets are available in the corresponding project repository.

* **Project 2** : [Instagram Poet using OCR and RNNs](/InstaPoet)

## Project 1: BBC Headlines Classifier using RNNs: 
In this project, I built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) to perform Multi-Label Classification on the [BBC Headlines Dataset](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) using Tensorflow and NLTK libraries for both preprocessing, and model building, training and validation respectively

**Key Tech:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Multi-Label classification, NLTK & Tensorflow

## Project 2: Instagram Poet using OCR and RNNs: 
In this project, I performed Webscraping to obtain a random instagram poet's posts, then performed Object Character Recognization (OCR) to strip the texts from the posts and then built and trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) to generate poetry from a given seed word. 

**Key Tech:** Webscraping , Object Character Recognization (OCR), RNNs, Text Generation & Tensorflow
